PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:

These files originate from the libbzip2 version 1.0.2 source obtained at
http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2 .  The bzip2 files included with Pipo-BBS
are a subset of the original bzip2 distribution.  Notably, they lack
documentation and the bzip2/bunzip2 application source.

The bzip2 files that have been included have been slightly modified by
restricting the inclusion of several sections of code if 'SKINNY' is
defined when compiling.  This has the effect of reducing the library size
and number of functions.  In particular this is used to limit the
included functionality to only decompression (i.e. not compression).

The license for bzip2 is included in the documentation directory of both
the Pipo-BBS source distribution and the release archive.

Thanks to Julian Seward and others who have worked on bzip2 for a truly
excellent and patent-free compression library.

Cheers,
