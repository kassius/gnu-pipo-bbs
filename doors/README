This is the location where included door programs would be located.
The door interface is a single multiplexed socket connection to a single
multiplexed server socket which resides in its own thread on the server
(one socket for each door).  Multiplexing these means that N clients could
use the same door program with just one process, one thread, and one socket
being used.  Also, this allows for easy 'multicasting', etc.  The API
and examples are coming in the next version; please stay tuned... :)
